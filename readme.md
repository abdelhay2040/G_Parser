## Parser

The most important class wich have the logic is  `ProductServiceImpl`, which is part of the service layer in the Gerimedica Parser Service application, responsible for handling business logic and data transactions with the `ProductRepository`. This class offers functionality to upload CSV files and perform CRUD operations on product data.

### Key Responsibilities

- **CSV Upload**: The `uploadCsvFile` method takes a `MultipartFile` as an argument, reads its content using a `BufferedReader`, and processes each record using `CSVParser`. It extracts data for each product, converts dates and priorities as needed, and persists the products using `ProductRepository`.
- **Data Retrieval**: Methods like `getAllProducts` and `getProductByCode` provide ways to fetch product details from the database.
- **Data Deletion**: The `deleteAllProducts` method allows for the removal of all product entries from the database.

### Exception Handling

Errors during CSV processing are logged, and a runtime exception is thrown to signal failure in file upload.

### Utility Methods

Two private helper methods, `parseDate` and `parseSortingPriority`, are used for parsing date fields and integer priorities from the CSV file, respectively.

### Future Development for Production Readiness

To prepare the `ProductServiceImpl` for production, the following enhancements are recommended:

- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implement more nuanced exception handling to differentiate between user errors and system errors, returning appropriate status codes and messages.
- **Transaction Management**: Ensure methods that write to the database are transactional, to maintain data integrity in case of partial failures.
- **Validation**: Add validation for CSV file content before attempting to parse and persist the data to prevent SQL injection or corruption of the database.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: For large files, implement asynchronous processing with feedback mechanisms to inform users of progress without blocking operations.
- **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize the CSV parsing and database interaction to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Security**: Ensure that only authenticated users can upload files and access product data.
- **Testing**: Increase test coverage, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure stability.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate advanced logging for monitoring and alerting, to be proactive about issues in production.
- **Documentation**: Provide API documentation using tools like Swagger for better understandability and ease of use by front-end developers or API consumers.
- **Scalability**: Design the service to be stateless so that it can be scaled horizontally to handle increased load.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement strategies for database backup and recovery to prevent data loss.
- **Data Privacy Compliance**: Ensure the application complies with data protection regulations like GDPR or HIPAA as applicable.

Incorporating these improvements will significantly increase the reliability, maintainability, and robustness of the `ProductServiceImpl`, making it better suited for a production environment.
